Notes: 
- Voltage running though the relay is about 20V DC. 
- Used a Feather HUZZA as it has a 5V out pin that can power the relay without an additional power source.
- Web server on the board uses a POST request to prevent accidental interaction by browser cache/previews that load a GET request behind the scenes. 
- See future videos for adding Siri Shortcuts and HomeKit integration.
